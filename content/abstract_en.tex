% \generalExpl{Enter your abstract here!}
% Write an abstract that is about 250 and 350 words (1/2 A4-page)  with the following components:
% key parts of the abstract
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item What is the topic area? (optional) Introduces the subject area for the project.
%   \item Short problem statement
%   \item Why was this problem worth a Bachelor's/Master’s thesis project? (\ie, why is the problem both significant and of a suitable degree of difficulty for a Bachelor's/Master’s thesis project? Why has no one else solved it yet?)
%   \item How did you solve the problem? What was your method/insight?
%   \item Results/Conclusions/Consequences/Impact: What are your key results/\linebreak[4]conclusions? What will others do based on your results? What can be done now that you have finished - that could not be done before your thesis project was completed?

% \engExpl{The following are some notes about what can be included (in terms of LaTeX) in your abstract.}
% Choice of typeface with \textbackslash textit, \textbackslash textbf, and \textbackslash texttt:  \textit{x}, \textbf{x}, and \texttt{x}.


% Text superscripts and subscripts with \textbackslash textsubscript and \textbackslash textsuperscript: A\textsubscript{x} and A\textsuperscript{x}.


% Some symbols that you might find useful are available, such as: \textbackslash textregistered, \textbackslash texttrademark, and \textbackslash textcopyright. For example,
% the copyright symbol: \textbackslash textcopyright Maguire 2022 results in \textcopyright Maguire 2022. Additionally, here are some examples of text superscripts (which can be combined with some symbols): \textbackslash textsuperscript\{99m\}Tc, A\textbackslash textsuperscript\{*\}, A\textbackslash textsuperscript\{\textbackslash textregistered\}, and A\textbackslash texttrademark resulting in \textsuperscript{99m}Tc, A\textsuperscript{*}, A\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, and A\texttrademark. Two examples of subscripts are: H\textbackslash textsubscript\{2\}O and CO\textbackslash textsubscript\{2\} which produce  H\textsubscript{2}O and CO\textsubscript{2}.


% You can use simple environments with begin and end: itemize and enumerate and within these use instances of \textbackslash item.


% The following commands can be used: \textbackslash eg, \textbackslash Eg, \textbackslash ie, \textbackslash Ie, \textbackslash etc, and \textbackslash etal: \eg, \Eg, \ie, \Ie, \etc, and \etal.


% The following commands for numbering with lowercase Roman numerals: \textbackslash first, \textbackslash Second, \textbackslash third, \textbackslash fourth, \textbackslash fifth, \textbackslash sixth, \textbackslash seventh, and \textbackslash eighth: \first, \Second, \third, \fourth, \fifth, \sixth, \seventh, and \eighth. Note that the second case is set with a capital 'S' to avoid conflicts with the use of second of as a unit in the \texttt{siunitx} package.


% Equations using \textbackslash( xxxx \textbackslash) or \textbackslash[ xxxx \textbackslash] can be used in the abstract. For example: \( (C_5O_2H_8)_n \)
% or \[ \int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx \]
% Note that you \textbf{cannot} use an equation between dollar signs.


% Even LaTeX comments can be handled, for example: \% comment.
% Note that one can include percentages, such as: 51\% or \SI{51}{\percent}.

\subsection*{Keywords}
\begin{scontents}[store-env=keywords,print-env=true]


% % If you set the EnglishKeywords earlier, you can retrieve them with:


\InsertKeywords{english}


% % If you did not set the EnglishKeywords earlier then simply enter the keywords here:


% % comma separate keywords, such as: Canvas Learning Management System, Docker containers, Performance tuning


\end{scontents}


% \engExpl{\textbf{Choosing good keywords can help others to locate your paper, thesis, dissertation, \ldots and related work.}}
% Choose the most specific keyword from those used in your domain, see for example: the ACM Computing Classification System ({\small \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/computing-classification-system/how-to-use})},
% the IEEE Taxonomy ({\small \url{https://www.ieee.org/publications/services/thesaurus-thank-you.html}}), PhySH (Physics Subject Headings)\linebreak[4] ({\small \url{https://physh.aps.org/}}), \ldots or keyword selection tools such as the  National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)  ({\small \url{https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/authors.html}}) or Google's Keyword Tool ({\small \url{https://keywordtool.io/}})\\


% \textbf{Formatting the keywords}:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item The first letter of a keyword should be set with a capital letter and proper names should be capitalized as usual.
%   \item Spell out acronyms and abbreviations.
%   \item Avoid "stop words" - as they generally carry little or no information.
%   \item List your keywords separated by commas (",").
% \end{itemize}
% Since you should have both English and Swedish keywords - you might think of ordering them in corresponding order (\ie, so that the n\textsuperscript{th} word in each list correspond) - this makes it easier to mechanically find matching keywords.
