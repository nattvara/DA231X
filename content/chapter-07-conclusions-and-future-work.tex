This chapter will provide conclusions from the research carried out in this thesis. It will reflect on the goals laid out in section~\ref{sec:goals} and what insights have been gained. It will describe the limitations to the result and discuss some future work.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}


% state the goals and research questions


One of the goals for this thesis was to understand the technological efficacy, i.e. speed and accuracy of various different tools and techniques commonly used when developing AI assistants. In addition to that, this thesis tried to understand what users preferred, various tools and the feasibility of operating \gls{LLM}on-premises. Lastly, a goal was to understand how AI assistants impacted education. All of this was encapsulated by the research questions, \textit{Which language model and which retrieval techniques do students prefer using?} and \textit{Is it possible to deploy an AI-assistant using a completely open source toolchain?}. My hypothesis was that the closed source alternatives would be better, however it would be feasible to build a completely open source and self-hosted AI assistant too.


% what was measured closed source models v open sourced


Generally, the hypothesis was correct. The results laid out in \autoref{ch:resultsAndAnalysis}, and section~\ref{sec:survey_questions_injected_into_the_chat} specifically, showed that students preferred the model provided by OpenAI to the Mistral model. Even though that comparison isn’t very fair model-to-model, the fact that self-hosting models that are as large as those available by for profit vendors, means that building an assistant on proprietary models will yield a better assistant. However, the results show generally favourable opinions from the users who had to use the open source model.


% embedding functions and full text search


Due to the size of the experiment, there weren't enough participants to test all the tools and techniques initially intended. The software constructed for the experiments was designed for testing more tools and models, such as some open source embedding functions. However, given these weren’t used in real chats, no conclusions were drawn regarding their effectiveness or effect on student satisfaction. For the same reason, no data was collected on how traditional search techniques, such as fulltext search, affected the metrics collected in the study.


% speed, accuracy and usefulness


The perceived speed, as reported by the users, was just slightly slower for the open source model used, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:feedback_01_frequency_of_answer_for_question_cbfea1}. This was also backed up by the recorded time each response took in \autoref{fig:performance_05_daily_average_response_time_including_pending_time}. The only measurement of accuracy in this study was the perceived accuracy by the users. This is a vert brute metric, however, it did produce a clear result that users perceived \textit{GPT-4} to produce more accurate results than the Mistrals model. Again, this was fairly inline with expectations. Larger open source models might produce even more accurate results. However, a model as capable as \textit{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2}, is not capable enough of building an AI assistant that users overwhelmingly think produce accurate results. The same conclusion can be drawn for the perceived usefulness of the assistants built with the different models.


% understand impact on education


Finally, the research conducted in this thesis did produce some insights on what impact chatbots and AI assistants could have on education. Students appreciated the quick and easy access to information. AI assistants could definitely improve student-teacher communications. This doesn’t mean that all student inquiries should be answered by a chatbot. Students prefer speaking to their actual teacher, however, a chatbot is a useful complement. While implementing such chatbots, the research in this thesis shows the technology selection is important. It is very important the information the bot has access to is accurate. While privacy is paramount for students, it’s still crucial teachers has insight into what the chatbot is telling students.

Due to the breadth of the problem, only some of the initial goals have been
met. In these section we will focus on some of the remaining issues that
should be addressed in future work. ...


\subsection{What has been left undone?}
\label{what-has-been-left-undone}


The prototype does not address the third requirment, \ie a yearly unavailability of less than 3 minutes; this remains an open problem. ...


\subsubsection{Cost analysis}


% \generalExpl{Example of a missing component}


The current prototype works, but the performance from a cost perspective makes this an impractical solution. Future work must reduce the cost of this solution; to do so, a cost analysis needs to first be done. ...


\subsubsection{Security}


% \generalExpl{Example of a missing component}


A future research effort is needed to address the security holes that results from using a self-signed certificate. Page filling text mass. Page filling text mass. ...


\subsection{Next obvious things to be done}


In particular, the author of this thesis wishes to point out xxxxxx remains as a problem to be solved. Solving this problem is the next thing that should be done. ...
