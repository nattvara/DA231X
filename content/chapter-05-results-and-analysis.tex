\section{Feasibility of building an AI assistant on open source technologies}


One of the goals of the research in this thesis was, as outlined in section~\ref{sec:goals}, to assess the feasibility of building an AI-assistant on open-source technologies and deploying the agent in an academic setting. This section will outline the results and showcase the impact open source tooling had on the implementation of the AI assistant.


\subsection{How popular was the system}


The system was developed during the spring of 2024 and gradually deployed to seven real courses at KTH starting on the 18th of April 2024. The students in the courses that participated in the study held a total of \input{results/latex_variables/usage-01-total-number-of-chats} chats. As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:usage_01_cumulative_number_of_chats} these steadily increased through over the course of the study as students initiated new chats with the assistant.


\input{results/plots/usage-01-cumulative-number-of-chats}


Separating the chats initiated in the separate course rooms we observe that some courses followed a fairly linear increase in the number of chats. One example of this is the course \textit{MG2040 Assembly Technology 6.0 credits}, which can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:usage_02_cumulative_number_of_chats_per_course}.


\input{results/plots/usage-02-cumulative-number-of-chats-per-course}


Looking at other courses in figure~\ref{fig:usage_02_cumulative_number_of_chats_per_course} it is evident that not all courses follow the same pattern as \textit{MG2040}. Some courses initially have very few chats due to the chatbot not being deployed simultaneously across all courses. \autoref{tab:course_start_dates} details the start dates for each course. For instance, \textit{DD1349 Projektuppgift i introduktion till datalogi 3,0 hp} exhibits a steep increase in users when it launched, followed by no further growth. This is because the course officially ended shortly after the chatbot was introduced. In all courses participating in the study, the chatbot was deployed well after the courses had already begun, therefore a similar pattern can be seen in many other courses.

\section{The impact of different LLM models on the speed, accuracy and reliability of responses}


This section will present and analyse the gathered data on user preference and technological efficacy of different tools and technologies such as different \gls{RAG} toolchains and \gls{LLM}, as outlined in section~\ref{sec:goals}.


\section{Qualitative analysis of user responses}


This section will present an analysis of the free text answers users have provided in the forms that have been presented in the participating courses.
